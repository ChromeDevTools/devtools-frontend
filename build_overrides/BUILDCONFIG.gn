#
# This is the main GN build configuration. This file is loaded after the
# build args (args.gn) for the build directory and after the toplevel ".gn"
# file (which points to this file as the build configuration).
#
# This particular version of BUILDCONFIG.gn is derived from the original
# at //build/config/BUILDCONFIG.gn, but does not include many of the toolchain
# settings that are relevant for compiling C++.

# BUILD FLAGS

# OS DEFINITIONS
# =============================================================================
#
# We set these various is_FOO booleans for convenience in writing OS-based
# conditions.
#
# - is_android, is_chromeos, is_ios, and is_win should be obvious.
# - is_mac is set only for desktop Mac. It is not set on iOS.
# - is_posix is true for mac and any Unix-like system (basically everything
#   except Windows).
# - is_linux is true for desktop Linux and ChromeOS, but not Android (which is
#   generally too different despite being based on the Linux kernel).
#
# Do not add more is_* variants here for random lesser-used Unix systems like
# aix or one of the BSDs. If you need to check these, just check the
# current_os value directly.
