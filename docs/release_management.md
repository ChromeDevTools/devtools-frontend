# Release Management

## Merges and Cherry-Picks

The documentation on cherry-picks and merges (including backmerges and backports) can be found in [`contributing_changes.md`](contributing_changes.md#merges-and-cherry_picks).

## Versioning

There is no explicit versioning being done. At the time of writing no compelling
use case was found that would require version numbers. Commits are identified by their commit hash, which should suffice for the projected future.

## What happens when Chromium cuts a new Canary branch

For each Chromium release branch, we create a mirror branch with the same name on our repo. Rough
outline:

1. Chromium cuts a branch e.g. 3879
1. Bots create Chromium/3879 branch on the DevTools frontend repo
1. The end

## Handling of Beta/Stable branches

Generally speaking, beta/stable branches are the same as Canary branches. There
is a special waterfall though, that runs tests on the beta/stable branches.

When Chromium updates to a new major version we need to update the branch number
in [infra/config](https://chromium.googlesource.com/devtools/devtools-frontend/+/refs/heads/infra/config)
branch of devtools-frontend. Specifically, in file buckets/ci.start, promote
the existing beta branch to stable section and modify beta section with the
corresponding branch number for the new Chromium milestone.

```python
generate_ci_configs(
    configurations = [
      ...
      config_section(
        name="beta",
        branch='refs/heads/chromium/4044',
      ),
      config_section(
        name="stable",
        branch='refs/heads/chromium/3987',
      ),
      ...
```

After editing the above mentioned file run `lucicfg generate main.star` to have the change propagated to the cfg files.

## Rolling/Integrating into Chromium

The [Skia
autoroller](https://skia.googlesource.com/buildbot/+/main/autoroll/README.md) is used. The DevTools-Frontend auto-roller state can be seen and controlled [here](https://autoroll.skia.org/r/devtools-frontend-chromium?tab=status).
