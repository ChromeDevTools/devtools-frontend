# Glossary

To stop mixing terms for UI elements across DevTools UI, its docs, and code, familiarize yourself with the terms in this glossary.

[TOC]

## Main tab bar

The primary tab bar at the top of the DevTools window. It contains the main
panels, such as **Elements**, **Console**, **Sources**.

You can reorder tabs, and move them between the main tab bar and the **Drawer**.

## Drawer

A container that can be shown or hidden at the bottom or right side of the
DevTools window. It provides access to additional tools, such as the
**Console**.

You can toggle the drawer with the `Esc` key and move panels between the main
tab bar and the drawer.

## Panel

A top-level tab in the DevTools window, including tabs from the **Drawer**
because you can [move them to the top](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/customize#reorder).

In other words, a panel is a fairly complex arrangement of information and
control elements put together on the basis of common sense.

![Panels in the main DevTools UI](./images/glossary-panels.png)

Despite the fact that it's also a tab, the term "panel" has been in use for
ages and all users are familiar with it. At the time of writing, DevTools
has 32 panels.

*** aside
Example: **Elements**, **Console**, **Network**, and **Sources** panels.

## Tab

*Inside a panel*, one of the labeled "bookmarks" in a set. Opens a single
respective "page" (view) when you "pull" it.

In other words, a single-select switch between several distinct UI parts.
Can be arranged:

- Horizontally, like **Styles** ... **Properties** in **Elements**
- Vertically, like **Preferences** ... **Shortcuts** in **Settings**

Examples: **Styles**, **Computed**, and **Properties** tabs inside the
**Elements** panel, or **Page**, **Workspace**, and **Snippets** tabs
inside the sidebar of the **Sources** panel.

## Section

A set of UI elements inside a panel and/or tab that is put together on the
