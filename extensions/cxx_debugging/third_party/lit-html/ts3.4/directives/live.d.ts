/**
 * Checks binding values against live DOM values, instead of previously bound
 * values, when determining whether to update the value.
 *
 * This is useful for cases where the DOM value may change from outside of
 * lit-html, such as with a binding to an `<input>` element's `value` property,
 * a content editable elements text, or to a custom element that changes it's
 * own properties or attributes.
 *
 * In these cases if the DOM value changes, but the value set through lit-html
 * bindings hasn't, lit-html won't know to update the DOM value and will leave
 * it alone. If this is not what you want—if you want to overwrite the DOM
 * value with the bound value no matter what—use the `live()` directive:
 *
 *     html`<input .value=${live(x)}>`
 *
 * `live()` performs a strict equality check agains the live DOM value, and if
 * the new value is equal to the live value, does nothing. This means that
 * `live()` should not be used when the binding will cause a type conversion. If
 * you use `live()` with an attribute binding, make sure that only strings are
 * passed in, or the binding will update every render.
