Description: lldb-eval is an LLDB-based library for evaluating debug expressions in the context of the debugged process. All modern debuggers support evaluating expressions to inspect the target process state: print out variables, access member fields, etc. lldb-eval is basically a REPL-like library, that allows to inspect the process state using the familiar C++ syntax. The primary use-case is IDE integration (for example, Stadia for Visual Studio).

In the DevTools C++ debugging extension, the package is used to parse C++ expressions for the Webassembly debugger (e.g., to evaluate watch window expressions or expressions in conditional breakpoints). The library is shipped with the extension, it is not shipped with chrome.

The library is used in a Webassembly sandbox. Make sure to consult the latest security guidelines if you intend to use the library outside of the Webassembly sandbox.
