 * The `IssuesModel` is a thin dispatch that does not store issues, but only creates the representation
 * class (usually derived from `Issue`) and passes the instances on via a dispatched event.
 * We chose this approach here because the lifetime of the Model is tied to the target, but DevTools
 * wants to preserve issues for targets (e.g. iframes) that are already gone as well.
