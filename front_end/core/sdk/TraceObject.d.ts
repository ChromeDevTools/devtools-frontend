 * PersistenceActions, but we so far just want the one to reveal in network panel, so add a new class which will only be
 * supported by Network panel.
 *
 * Also we want to have a different behavior(select the network request) from the `SDK.NetworkRequest.NetworkRequest`
 * (highlight the network request once).
