# `rn_fusebox.html`

`rn_fusebox.html` is a customized entry point designed to work well with React Native targets. This entry point is designed to work with all features of the next-gen debugging stack (codename: React Fusebox âš¡).

## Notes on embedding

* Adding `&sources.hide_add_folder=true` to the inspector frontend URL hides UI related to Filesystem / Workspaces that does not work in hosted mode.
