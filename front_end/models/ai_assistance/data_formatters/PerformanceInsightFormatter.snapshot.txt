Title: PerformanceInsightFormatter LCP Request discovery serializes the correct details
Content:
## Insight Title: LCP request discovery

## Insight Summary:
This insight analyzes the time taken to discover the LCP resource and request it on the network. It only applies if the LCP element was a resource like an image that has to be fetched over the network. There are 3 checks this insight makes:
1. Did the resource have `fetchpriority=high` applied?
2. Was the resource discoverable in the initial document, rather than injected from a script or stylesheet?
3. The resource was not lazy loaded as this can delay the browser loading the resource.

It is important that all of these checks pass to minimize the delay between the initial page load and the LCP resource being loaded.

## Detailed analysis:
The Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) time for this navigation was 1,077 ms.
The LCP element is an image fetched from http://localhost:8787/lcp-discovery-delay/lcp-image.jpg (eventKey: s-25281, ts: 197696859337).

## Insight Summary:
This insight checks that the first request is responded to promptly. We use the following criteria to check this:
1. Was the initial request redirected?
2. Did the server respond in 600ms or less? We want developers to aim for as close to 100ms as possible, but our threshold for this insight is 600ms.
3. Was there compression applied to the response to minimize the transfer size?

Title: PerformanceInsightFormatter INP breakdown serializes the correct details
Content:
## Insight Title: INP breakdown

## Insight Summary:
Interaction to Next Paint (INP) is a metric that tracks the responsiveness of the page when the user interacts with it. INP is a Core Web Vital and the thresholds for how we categorize a score are:
- Good: 200 milliseconds or less.
- Needs improvement: more than 200 milliseconds and 500 milliseconds or less.
- Bad: over 500 milliseconds.

For a given slow interaction, we can break it down into 3 phases:
1. Input delay: starts when the user initiates an interaction with the page, and ends when the event callbacks for the interaction begin to run.
2. Processing duration: the time it takes for the event callbacks to run to completion.
3. Presentation delay: the time it takes for the browser to present the next frame which contains the visual result of the interaction.

The sum of these three phases is the total latency. It is important to optimize each of these phases to ensure interactions take as little time as possible. Focusing on the phase that has the largest score is a good way to start optimizing.

## Detailed analysis:
The longest interaction on the page was a `click` which had a total duration of `980 ms`. The timings of each of the three phases were:

1. Input delay: 1 ms
2. Processing duration: 977 ms
3. Presentation delay: 2 ms.

Title: PerformanceInsightFormatter ModernHTTP serializes the correct details when no requests are using legacy http
Content:
## Insight Title: Modern HTTP

## Insight Summary:
Modern HTTP protocols, such as HTTP/2, are more efficient than older versions like HTTP/1.1 because they allow for multiple requests and responses to be sent over a single network connection, significantly improving page load performance by reducing latency and overhead. This insight identifies requests that can be upgraded to a modern HTTP protocol.

We apply a conservative approach when flagging HTTP/1.1 usage. This insight will only flag requests that meet all of the following criteria:
1.  Were served over HTTP/1.1 or an earlier protocol.
2.  Originate from an origin that serves at least 6 static asset requests, as the benefits of multiplexing are less significant with fewer requests.
3.  Are not served from 'localhost' or coming from a third-party source, where developers have no control over the server's protocol.

To pass this insight, ensure your server supports and prioritizes a modern HTTP protocol (like HTTP/2) for static assets, especially when serving a substantial number of them.

## Detailed analysis:
There are no requests that were served over a legacy HTTP protocol.

## Insight Title: Optimize DOM size

## Insight Summary:
This insight evaluates some key metrics about the Document Object Model (DOM) and identifies excess in the DOM tree, for example:
- The maximum number of elements within the DOM.
- The maximum number of children for any given element.
- Excessive depth of the DOM structure.
- The largest layout and style recalculation events.

## Detailed analysis:
A large DOM can increase the duration of style calculations and layout reflows, impacting page responsiveness. A large DOM will also increase memory usage. [Learn how to avoid an excessive DOM size](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/performance/insights/dom-size).

Statistic:

Total elements: 1006.
DOM depth: 1001 nodes, starting with element 'SPAN' (node id: 27).
Most children: 5, for parent 'BODY' (node id: 19).

Large layout updates/style calculations:

  - Layout update: Duration: 59 ms, with 2004 of 2012 nodes needing layout.
  - Style recalculation: Duration: 151 ms, with 1001 elements affected.

## Insight Title: Forced reflow

## Insight Summary:
This insight identifies forced synchronous layouts (also known as forced reflows) and layout thrashing caused by JavaScript accessing layout properties at suboptimal points in time.

## Detailed analysis:
A forced reflow occurs when JavaScript queries geometric properties (such as `offsetWidth`) after styles have been invalidated by a change to the DOM state. This can result in poor performance. Learn more about [forced reflows](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/performance/insights/forced-reflow) and possible mitigations.

## Insight Title: Network dependency tree

## Insight Summary:
This insight analyzes the network dependency tree to identify:
- The maximum critical path latency (the longest chain of network requests that the browser must download before it can render the page).
- Whether current [preconnect] tags are appropriate, according to the following rules:
   1. They should all be in use (no unnecessary preconnects).
   2. All preconnects should specify cross-origin correctly.
   3. The maximum of 4 preconnects should be respected.
- Opportunities to add [preconnect] for a faster loading experience.

## Detailed analysis:
The network dependency tree checks revealed no problems, but optimization suggestions may be available.

No rendering tasks impacted by network dependencies.

Content:
## Insight Title: CSS Selector costs

## Insight Summary:
This insight identifies CSS selectors that are slowing down your page's rendering performance.

## Detailed analysis:
One or more slow CSS selectors were identified as negatively affecting page performance:

Top selector match attempt:
169 attempts for selector: '.gb_Bd > :only-child'

Total:
Elapsed time: 0 ms
Match attempts: 2444
Match count: 465

If Recalculate Style costs remain high, selector optimization can reduce them. [Optimize the selectors](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/performance/insights/slow-css-selector) with both high elapsed time and high slow-path %. Simpler selectors, fewer selectors, a smaller DOM, and a shallower DOM will all reduce matching costs.
