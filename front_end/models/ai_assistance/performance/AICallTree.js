     * Iterates through nodes level by level using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.
     * BFS is important here because the serialization process assumes that direct child nodes
     * will have consecutive IDs (horizontally across each depth).
     *
     * Example tree with IDs:
     *
     *             1
     *            / \
     *           2   3
     *        / / /   \
     *      4  5 6     7
     *
     * Here, node with an ID 2 has consecutive children in the 4-6 range.
     *
     * To optimize for space, the provided `callback` function is called to serialize
     * each node as it's visited during the BFS traversal.
     *
     * When serializing a node, the callback receives:
     * 1. The current node being visited.
     * 2. The ID assigned to this current node (a simple incrementing index based on visit order).
     * 3. The predicted starting ID for the children of this current node.
     *
     * A serialized node needs to know the ID range of its children. However,
     * child node IDs are only assigned when those children are themselves visited.
     * To handle this, we predict the starting ID for a node's children. This prediction
     * is based on a running count of all nodes that have ever been added to the BFS queue.
     * Since IDs are assigned consecutively as nodes are processed from the queue, and a
     * node's children are added to the end of the queue when the parent is visited,
     * their eventual IDs will follow this running count.
