# Annotations Model

**IMPORTANT**: this model exists because on the GreenDev project we prototyped a build of DevTools that is able to add annotations to various parts of the UI.

This feature is only enabled when Chromium is run with the GreenDev feature flag enabled. There are currently NO PLANS to ship this code to production.

If you are reading this and you want to use this code, please speak to jacktfranklin@ first. This code is for a prototype and not in a production state.
