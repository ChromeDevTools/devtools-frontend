# An 'input' element should have an 'id' or 'name' attribute

An `input` element has neither an `id` nor a `name` attribute. This might prevent the browser from autofilling the `form`.

If there is no `autocomplete` attribute, it's recommended to add a unique `id` or `name` attribute to a `form` field to make autofill reliable.
