# Activation disabled

The "{PLACEHOLDER_Type}" element could not be activated for the following reason: {PLACEHOLDER_DisableReason}.

The element is occluded by: "{PLACEHOLDER_OccluderInfo}"

To resolve this issue, ensure that the element follows all styling restrictions and is fully visible to the user.

You can use the command line flag `--runtime-enabled-features=BypassPepcSecurityForTesting` to bypass this behavior for testing purposes.
