# Request in progress

A permission request on the "{PLACEHOLDER_Type}" element was prevented because a previous request is still in progress.

To resolve this issue, ensure that the site does not allow users to interact with the element behind the current content scrim (for example by moving the element to a document in a new window, which is not covered by the scrim).
