// This allows us to model the behavior of the TraceProcessor in the model,
// which takes an object with TraceEventHandlers as part of its config, and
// which ultimately returns an object keyed off the names of the
// TraceEventHandlers, and with values that are derived from each
// TraceEventHandler's data function.
//
// So, concretely, we provide a TraceEventHandler for calculating the #time
// bounds of a trace called TraceBounds, whose data() function returns a
// TraceWindow. The HandlerData, therefore, would determine that the
// TraceProcessor would contain a key called 'TraceBounds' whose value is
// a TraceWindow.
