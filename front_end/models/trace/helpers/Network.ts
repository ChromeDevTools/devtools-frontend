// Important: we purposefully treat `potentially_blocking` as
// non-render-blocking here because:
// 1. An async script can run on the main thread at any point, including before
//    the page is loaded
// 2. An async script will never block the parsing and rendering process of the
//    browser.
// 3. Therefore, from a developer's point of view, there is nothing more they
//    can do if they've put `async` on, and within the context of Insights, we
//    shouldn't report an async script as render blocking.
// In the future we may want to consider suggesting the use of `defer` over
// `async`, as it doesn't have this concern, but for now we'll allow `async`
// and not report it as an issue.
