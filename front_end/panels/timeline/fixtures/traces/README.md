# Traces

This folder contains traces saved by the DevTools Performance Panel that can be used in tests.

To add a trace, copy the `*.json.gz` file into this folder, and add it to the `BUILD.gn`. You can also add the unzipped `*.json` file, but these are git-ignored. However, it's useful when working with a trace file to have it extracted and inspectable!

There are two helpers you can use to load a trace file into a test, depending on which model you are working with:

## OPP "legacy" model

Use `loadTraceEventsLegacyEventPayload`. This loads the file and assumes it returns a list of `SDK.TracingManager.EventPayload` events.

### Insights model

The Insights model supports trace files in two forms:

1. An array of events.
2. An object, with an array of `traceEvents` and associated `metadata`

You can use `loadEventsFromTraceFile` to return all the events in a trace file. If you want to load the entire file, you can use `loadTraceFile`.

If you have created an example website to generate a trace, consider contributing it to the [Performance Stories repository](https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/performance-stories).

# Trace descriptions

**If you add a trace, please update this file with a description of the file and how it was generated**.

NOTE: The list of traces below is alphabetically-sorted.

This trace loads `index.html`, with an iframe to load `example.com`. It then
loads `page2.html`, which also loads `example.com` in an iFrame. This trace is

A trace of web.dev being loaded.

### web-dev-initial-url.json.gz

This is a trace where we loaded web.dev/inp, but the initial URL reported by the TraceStartedInBrowser event states google.com (the previous page). In this situation the MetaHandler would produce google.com as the mainFrameURL which is incorrect. This trace was used to write a test to ensure in this instance if we can we try to calculate the actual domain by looking at the first navigation.

### web-dev-modifications.json.gz

Contains a recording of web-dev with the following modifications:

- One entry with hidden children
- A child breadcrumb under the total trace window.

### web-dev-screenshot-source-ids.json.gz

### web-dev-with-commit.json.gz

The web-dev trace is old (recorded in 2021) and since its recording the events relating to frames have changed. In particular CompositeLayers was replaced by Commit, and frameSeqId was added to more events. This is a more recent (Nov 2023) trace that has the newer frame-related events in it. This was used when migrating the TimelineFrameModel to the new engine.

### web-dev-with-timings.json.gz

A trace of web.dev recorded in May 2025. Done because it contains performance timings marks and measures, which are useful and in this case used as a repro case for crbug.com/418223469.
