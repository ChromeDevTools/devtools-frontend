To update this package, adjust the version ranges in package.json if necessary, and run the following command:

It will use npm to locally install the necessary packages and their dependencies, and bundle them into a single file (codemirror.js and codemirror.d.ts) with rollup.

If you want to easily obtain all the latest versions of the packages, run the following:

```
npm i
npm outdated

This will show you a table with all the latest versions of each package.
