Description:
CSP Evaluator allows developers and security experts to check if a Content Security Policy (CSP) serves as a strong mitigation against cross-site scripting attacks.
It assists with the process of reviewing CSP policies, and helps identify subtle CSP bypasses which undermine the value of a policy.
CSP Evaluator checks are based on a large-scale study and are aimed to help developers to harden their CSP and improve the security of their applications.
