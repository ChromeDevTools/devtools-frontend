       "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
       "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
       "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
       "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.
    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:
       (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
       (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and
       (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and
       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.
       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.
    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

     * expected by prepending the selection string with `<name>/`. The name is
     * only allowed to consist of lower- and upper case latin letters.
     *
     * @example
     *
     * ```ts
     * Puppeteer.customQueryHandlers.register('lit', { … });
     * const aHandle = await page.$('lit/…');
     * ```
     *
     * @param name - Name to register under.
     * @param queryHandler - {@link CustomQueryHandler | Custom query handler} to
     * register.

  /**
   * ElementHandle represents an in-page DOM element.
   *
   * @remarks
   * ElementHandles can be created with the {@link Page.$} method.
   *
   * ```ts
   * import puppeteer from 'puppeteer';
   *
   * (async () => {
   *   const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
   *   const page = await browser.newPage();
   *   await page.goto('https://example.com');
   *   const hrefElement = await page.$('a');
   *   await hrefElement.click();
   *   // ...
   * })();
   * ```
   *
   * ElementHandle prevents the DOM element from being garbage-collected unless the
   * handle is {@link JSHandle.dispose | disposed}. ElementHandles are auto-disposed
   * when their origin frame gets navigated.
   *
   * ElementHandle instances can be used as arguments in {@link Page.$eval} and
   * {@link Page.evaluate} methods.
   *
   * If you're using TypeScript, ElementHandle takes a generic argument that
   * denotes the type of element the handle is holding within. For example, if you
   * have a handle to a `<select>` element, you can type it as
   * `ElementHandle<HTMLSelectElement>` and you get some nicer type checks.
   *
   * @public

   * Represents a DOM frame.
   *
   * To understand frames, you can think of frames as `<iframe>` elements. Just
   * like iframes, frames can be nested, and when JavaScript is executed in a
   * frame, the JavaScript does not affect frames inside the ambient frame the
   * JavaScript executes in.
   *
   * @example
   * At any point in time, {@link Page | pages} expose their current frame
   * tree via the {@link Page.mainFrame} and {@link Frame.childFrames} methods.
   *
   * @example
   * An example of dumping frame tree:
   *
   * ```ts
   * import puppeteer from 'puppeteer';
   *
   * (async () => {
   *   const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
   *   const page = await browser.newPage();
   *   await page.goto('https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/canary.html');
   *   dumpFrameTree(page.mainFrame(), '');
   *   await browser.close();
   *
   *   function dumpFrameTree(frame, indent) {
   *     console.log(indent + frame.url());
   *     for (const child of frame.childFrames()) {
   *       dumpFrameTree(child, indent + '  ');
   *     }
   *   }
   * })();
   * ```
   *
   * @example
   * An example of getting text from an iframe element:
   *
   * ```ts
   * const frames = page.frames();
   * let frame = null;
   * for (const currentFrame of frames) {
   *   const frameElement = await currentFrame.frameElement();
   *   const name = await frameElement.evaluate(el => el.getAttribute('name'));
   *   if (name === 'myframe') {
   *     frame = currentFrame;
   *     break;
   *   }
   * }
   * if (frame) {
   *   const text = await frame.$eval(
   *     '.selector',
   *     element => element.textContent,
   *   );
   *   console.log(text);
   * } else {
   *   console.error('Frame with name "myframe" not found.');
   * }
   * ```

   * await page.mouse.move(0, 0);
   * await page.mouse.up();
   * ```
   *
   * **Note**: The mouse events trigger synthetic `MouseEvent`s.
   * This means that it does not fully replicate the functionality of what a normal user
   * would be able to do with their mouse.
   *
   * For example, dragging and selecting text is not possible using `page.mouse`.
   * Instead, you can use the {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DocumentOrShadowRoot/getSelection | `DocumentOrShadowRoot.getSelection()`} functionality implemented in the platform.
   *
   * @example
   * For example, if you want to select all content between nodes:
   *
   * ```ts
   * await page.evaluate(
   *   (from, to) => {
   *     const selection = from.getRootNode().getSelection();
   *     const range = document.createRange();
   *     range.setStartBefore(from);
   *     range.setEndAfter(to);
   *     selection.removeAllRanges();
   *     selection.addRange(range);
   *   },
   *   fromJSHandle,
   *   toJSHandle,
   * );
   * ```
   *
   * If you then would want to copy-paste your selection, you can use the clipboard api:
   *
   * ```ts
   * // The clipboard api does not allow you to copy, unless the tab is focused.
   * await page.bringToFront();
   * await page.evaluate(() => {
   *   // Copy the selected content to the clipboard
   *   document.execCommand('copy');
   *   // Obtain the content of the clipboard as a string
   *   return navigator.clipboard.readText();
   * });
   * ```
   *
   * **Note**: If you want access to the clipboard API,
   * you have to give it permission to do so:
   *
   * ```ts
   * await browser
   *   .defaultBrowserContext()
   *   .overridePermissions('<your origin>', [
   *     'clipboard-read',
   *     'clipboard-write',

   * in the browser.
   *
   * :::note
   *
   * One Browser instance might have multiple Page instances.
   *
   * :::
   *
   * @example
   * This example creates a page, navigates it to a URL, and then saves a screenshot:
   *
   * ```ts
   * import puppeteer from 'puppeteer';
   *
   * (async () => {
   *   const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
   *   const page = await browser.newPage();
   *   await page.goto('https://example.com');
   *   await page.screenshot({path: 'screenshot.png'});
   *   await browser.close();
   * })();
   * ```
   *
   * The Page class extends from Puppeteer's {@link EventEmitter} class and will
   * emit various events which are documented in the {@link PageEvent} enum.
   *
   * @example
   * This example logs a message for a single page `load` event:
   *
   * ```ts
   * page.once('load', () => console.log('Page loaded!'));
   * ```
   *
   * To unsubscribe from events use the {@link EventEmitter.off} method:
   *
   * ```ts
   * function logRequest(interceptedRequest) {
   *   console.log('A request was made:', interceptedRequest.url());
   * }
   * page.on('request', logRequest);
   * // Sometime later...
   * page.off('request', logRequest);

       * The only difference between {@link Page.evaluate | page.evaluate} and
       * `page.evaluateHandle` is that `evaluateHandle` will return the value
       * wrapped in an in-page object.
       *
       * If the function passed to `page.evaluateHandle` returns a Promise, the
       * function will wait for the promise to resolve and return its value.
       *
       * You can pass a string instead of a function (although functions are
       * recommended as they are easier to debug and use with TypeScript):
       *
       * @example
       *
       * ```ts
       * const aHandle = await page.evaluateHandle('document');
       * ```
       *
       * @example
       * {@link JSHandle} instances can be passed as arguments to the `pageFunction`:
       *
       * ```ts
       * const aHandle = await page.evaluateHandle(() => document.body);
       * const resultHandle = await page.evaluateHandle(
       *   body => body.innerHTML,
       *   aHandle,
       * );
       * console.log(await resultHandle.jsonValue());
       * await resultHandle.dispose();
       * ```
       *
       * Most of the time this function returns a {@link JSHandle},
       * but if `pageFunction` returns a reference to an element,
       * you instead get an {@link ElementHandle} back:
       *
       * @example
       *
       * ```ts
       * const button = await page.evaluateHandle(() =>
       *   document.querySelector('button'),
       * );
       * // can call `click` because `button` is an `ElementHandle`
       * await button.click();
       * ```
       *
       * The TypeScript definitions assume that `evaluateHandle` returns
       * a `JSHandle`, but if you know it's going to return an
       * `ElementHandle`, pass it as the generic argument:
       *
       * ```ts
       * const button = await page.evaluateHandle<ElementHandle>(...);
       * ```
       *
       * @param pageFunction - a function that is run within the page
       * @param args - arguments to be passed to the pageFunction
       */
      async evaluateHandle(pageFunction, ...args) {
        pageFunction = withSourcePuppeteerURLIfNone(this.evaluateHandle.name, pageFunction);
        return await this.mainFrame().evaluateHandle(pageFunction, ...args);
      }
      /**
       * This method finds the first element within the page that matches the selector
       * and passes the result as the first argument to the `pageFunction`.
       *
       * @remarks
       *
       * If no element is found matching `selector`, the method will throw an error.
       *
       * If `pageFunction` returns a promise `$eval` will wait for the promise to
       * resolve and then return its value.
       *
       * @example
       *
       * ```ts
       * const searchValue = await page.$eval('#search', el => el.value);
       * const preloadHref = await page.$eval('link[rel=preload]', el => el.href);
       * const html = await page.$eval('.main-container', el => el.outerHTML);
       * ```
       *
       * If you are using TypeScript, you may have to provide an explicit type to the
       * first argument of the `pageFunction`.
       * By default it is typed as `Element`, but you may need to provide a more
       * specific sub-type:
       *
       * @example
       *
       * ```ts
       * // if you don't provide HTMLInputElement here, TS will error
       * // as `value` is not on `Element`
       * const searchValue = await page.$eval(
       *   '#search',
       *   (el: HTMLInputElement) => el.value,
       * );
       * ```
       *
       * The compiler should be able to infer the return type
       * from the `pageFunction` you provide. If it is unable to, you can use the generic
       * type to tell the compiler what return type you expect from `$eval`:
       *
       * @example
       *
       * ```ts
       * // The compiler can infer the return type in this case, but if it can't
       * // or if you want to be more explicit, provide it as the generic type.
       * const searchValue = await page.$eval<string>(
       *   '#search',
       *   (el: HTMLInputElement) => el.value,
       * );
       * ```
       *

       * The optional Parameter in Arguments `options` are:

       * - `visible`: A boolean wait for element to be present in DOM and to be
       *   visible, i.e. to not have `display: none` or `visibility: hidden` CSS
       *   properties. Defaults to `false`.
       *
       * - `hidden`: Wait for element to not be found in the DOM or to be hidden,
       *   i.e. have `display: none` or `visibility: hidden` CSS properties. Defaults to
       *   `false`.
       *
       * - `timeout`: maximum time to wait for in milliseconds. Defaults to `30000`
       *   (30 seconds). Pass `0` to disable timeout. The default value can be changed
       *   by using the {@link Page.setDefaultTimeout} method.
