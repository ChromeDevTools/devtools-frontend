Huge props to [WordAds](https://wordads.co/) for reducing their impact from ~2.5s to ~200ms on average! A few entities are showing considerably less data this cycle (Media Math, Crazy Egg, DoubleVerify, Bootstrap CDN). Perhaps they've added new CDNs/hostnames that we haven't identified or the basket of sites in HTTPArchive has shifted away from their usage.
