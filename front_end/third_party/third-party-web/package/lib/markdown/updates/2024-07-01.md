Some third parties use a dynamic subdomain to serve its main script on websites (e.g .domain.com). Some of these subdomain scripts are saved under observed-domains JSON file as results of the `sql/all-observed-domains-query.sql` query but analyzing http archive database we found a lot that are ignored because of number of occurrences (less than 50 ).

So, we've created a new query to keep observed domains with occurrence below 50 only if its mapped entity (based on entity.js) has a total occurrence (of all its declared domain) greater than 50.
