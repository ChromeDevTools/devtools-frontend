## Bumping.

```bash
./front_end/third_party/web-vitals/rebuild.sh

# Also, consider commenting out roll script to just recompile without a bump, however this will reset some edits 2,3 listed below.
```

## DevTools edits to web-vitals

1. There's a sed edit in the rebuild.sh to expose `attributeINP`. That'll continue in v5 but be harder to do.
2. Some lines are manually commented out in `attribution/onINP.js`'s `saveInteractionTarget`.  b/376777343 Unknown if needed in v5.
3. Some lines are added in `onHidden.js` to resolve a memory leak. Not needed in v5. b/425309898#comment4
4. (Not part of package, but..) There's a hack to clear `interactionTargetElement` in our own web-vitals-injected that won't be necessary in v5.
