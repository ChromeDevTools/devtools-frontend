## FAQs

> Wasn't this a google doc before?

Yes. The original version of this documentation was a publicly accessible Google Doc. However, keeping the documentation apart from the code was a challenge, along with the fact that Docs aren't the best for dealing with lots of code. That motivated the change to move the documentation into the repository, hopefully helping it keep up to date and still remaining public.

> What should I do if I want to make a change?
