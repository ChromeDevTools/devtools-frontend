  Use this file to render a track of the Performance Panel timeline in
  isolation. Use the following search params to customize the track to
  be rendered:
    - track: The name of the track to be rendered. It could either be
      A track added by the legacy system (it has a codepath that appends
      it to the timeline in
      TimelineFlameChartDataProvider.appendLegacyTrackData). In this
      case the value of this param must be an entry from the
      TimelineModel.TimelineModel.TrackType enum.

      Or it could be a track appended by the new system. In this case
      the value must be an entry from
      Timeline.CompatibilityTracksAppender.TrackNames.

    - fileName: the name of the trace file to be loaded (without the
      .json.gz extension).
     Example: track_example.html?track=GPU&fileName=threejs-gpu

    - optionally, you can also use trackFilter to filter the tracks by name.
      This is useful if you are loading a track type that can contain multipole
      tracks (e.g. TrackType.Other). Any tracks that contain the provided string will
      be shown.
      Example: track_example.html?track=Other&fileName=fenced-frame-fledge&trackFilter=Worklet
