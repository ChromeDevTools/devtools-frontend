Resolving these issues will be essential to meet Chrome’s flake reduction goals.\n\nThis bug has led to a large number of gardened builds failing in the last 7 days. List of gardened build failures caused by this cluster can be viewed at:\nhttps://data.corp.google.com/sites/chrome_generic_flakiness_dashboard_datasite/build_failures/?av=rpqxzw:ktu56&fb=is_sheriff_or_cq_builder:eq:true&f=cluster_name:in:b%2F\nor in LUCI Analysis and grouped by builders:\n{{.RuleURL}}?tab=recent-failures&filterToMetric=builds-failed-due-to-flaky-tests&groupBy=builder&orderBy=invocationFailures\n\nPlease consider the following strategies to mitigate the impact from this issue which are rated in order of resolution preference:\n1. Resolve the underlying test issue.\n2. Move the flaky test from Critical Builders to FYI Builder\n3. Disable test (least desirable as it reduces test coverage) and add a Test-Disabled label to this issue. The disabled tests might continue running in reviver builders (go/test-reviver), see config [1] for a list of supported builders.\n\nhttp://go/resolve-chrome-top-flakes provides more information on the tools available for resolving flaky tests.\n\nWhen investigating this failure, you may identify this bug is too broad (encompasses multiple different issues) or too narrow (only captures one part of a larger issue). If this applies, you can combine issues[2]  or split issues[3].\n\nLinks:\n[1] https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:infra/config/subprojects/reviver/reviver.star\n[2] https://luci-analysis.appspot.com/help#combining-issues\n[3] https://luci-analysis.appspot.com/help#splitting-issues"
