/**
 * Operations are promises that can have <a
 * href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science)">effects</a>
 * added on them (through {@link Operation.effect}).
 *
 * Semantically-speaking, adding an effect equates to guaranteeing the operation
 * causes the added effect.
 *
 * The first effect that errors will propogate its error back to the operation.
 *
 * @example
 *
 * ```ts
 * await input.click().effect(async () => {
 *   await page.waitForNavigation();
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @remarks
 *
 * Adding effects to a completed operation will result in an error. This occurs
 * when either
 *
 * 1. the effects are added asynchronously or
 * 2. the operation was awaited before effects were added.
 *
 * For example for (1),
 *
 * ```ts
 * const operation = input.click();
 * await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
 * await operation.effect(() => console.log('Works!')); // This will throw because of (1).
 * ```
 *
 * For example for (2),
 *
 * ```ts
 * const operation = await input.click();
 * await operation.effect(() => console.log('Works!')); // This will throw because of (2).
 * ```
 *
 * Tl;dr, effects **must** be added synchronously (no `await` statements between
 * the time the operation is created and the effect is added).
