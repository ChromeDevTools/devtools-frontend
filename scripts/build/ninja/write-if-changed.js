/**
 * Only write content to a file if the content is different that what it previously contained.
 * The reason for only writing when necessary is that GN uses file timestamps to determine freshness.
 * Therefore, if the file contents hasn't changed, but the timestamp has, GN thinks the file is new.
 *
 * Instead, we can only write when the content is changed, meaning we don't touch a file when it is
 * unchanged. This would preserve the original file timestamps and hence GN can correctly conclude
 * the file output hasn't changed.
 *
 * @param generatedFileLocation Location to write to
 * @param newContents The contents to write (or noop if unchanged with previous content)
