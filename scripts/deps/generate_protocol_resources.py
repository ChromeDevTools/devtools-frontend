# We are still generating PDL types as an out-of-process manual task, rather
# than in GN. There are some technical nuances here, but broadly speaking CDP
# is backwards compatible. That means that if you would update CDP, and
# DevTools was built with the expectation of an older version of CDP, that
# should compile and run. This is generally true, but sadly not always. As it
# turns out, the CDP owners regard some domains in CDP as "experimental",
# which is not covered by the backwards compatibility guarantee.

# The concrete result of that is that, sometimes, the CDP owners update the
# CDP definitions in such a way that it would break compilation of DevTools.
# That would happen if the types change, methods or events are removed and all
# of that integrates with our TypeScript build, which would start failing. As
# such, if the CDP definitions change and DevTools would break on it, we
# currently have to manually patch these on DevTools side. This currently
# happens when DevTools engineers roll our deps, regenerate the types, run the
# build and figure out if manually patching is required. Most of the time,
# there are no functional changes required, but there are rare cases where it
# is required. (Generally speaking, those that introduced the CDP breakage tend
# to be the ones resolving the breakage as well.)

# If we were to take the PDL definition from Chromium and compile DevTools with
# it, we effectively block any breaking change in CDP. The CDP owners indicated
# that they would like to maintain the freedom of making breaking changes in
# several domains, so that disallows us from integrating the PDL definition in
# the DevTools build. That's why we have to maintain a copy of CDP that we
# build DevTools with and ensure that we remain up-to-date on the Chromium side,
# resolving type breakages whenever they occur.

# There is another reason why we generate the types manually: so that VS Code
# picks them up and makes them available for usage in the editor. If we
# wouldn't generate them, then VS Code (or any other IDE with a TypeScript
# language server) would not see the types and start complaining,
# even though the local build would succeed.
