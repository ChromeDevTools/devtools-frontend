# Testing Guide

[goo.gle/devtools-testing-guide](http://goo.gle/devtools-testing-guide)

Follow the steps outlined in [Get the Code](../docs/get_the_code.md) to checkout the DevTools front-end code.

[TOC]

## DevTools front-end tests

The `devtools-frontend` repository contains a variety of test suites, check
out the individual guides below:

* [Unit Testing Guide](./unit/README.md)
* [E2E Testing Guide](./e2e/README.md)
* [Performance Testing Guide](./perf/README.md)

You can use

```
npm test
```

to run all tests in the devtools frontend repo. You can also run just a
subset of tests like this:

```
npm test \
   front_end/core/common/Color.test.ts \
   front_end/core/sdk
```

The current test status can be seen at the
[test waterfall](https://ci.chromium.org/p/devtools-frontend/g/main/console).

### Obtaining code coverage

We can collect code coverage for the source code that is tested: `npm run test -- --coverage`. This is available for
unit tests.

The code coverage output is written to `/karma-coverage` in the repository root. The
location can be overriden with `--artifacts-dir`.  You can open `/karma-coverage/index.html` in a browser to inspect
coverage for individual files.

## Layout tests

After building content shell as part of Chromium, we can also run layout tests that are relevant for DevTools front-end:

```
autoninja -C out/Default blink_tests
third_party/blink/tools/run_web_tests.py -t Default http/tests/devtools
```

To debug a failing layout test we can run
```
npm run debug-webtest -- http/tests/devtools/<path>/<to>/<test>.js
```

The script supports either default DevTools checkout inside the chromium tree or side-by-side checkouts of chromium and
DevTools. Passing `--custom-devtools-frontend` is not supported currently, meaning in the side-by-side scenario the
DevTools checkout inside the chromium tree will be used (if not symlinked).

*** note
**Note:** Layout tests usually do not actually test the layout or anything UI related. With `content_shell`,
it runs the Blink renderer with DevTools front-end embedded, and executes scripted JavaScript commands to
load DevTools front-end modules, and exercises some code paths. It dumps some results as strings to compare
against expectation files.
***

Since these tests live in Chromium, we may need to perform three-way changes when changing DevTools front-end. Example: disable test in Chromium (https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/5851392), land front-end CL, then update and re-enable the Chromium test.

## DevTools back-end tests

The DevTools back-end is distributed across Chromium and V8, and is tested mainly via

* Blink Inspector protocol tests (in [`third_party/blink/web_tests/inspector-protocol/`](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/blink/web_tests/inspector-protocol/) and [`third_party/blink/web_tests/http/tests/inspector-protocol/`](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/blink/web_tests/http/tests/inspector-protocol/)),
* V8 Inspector tests (in [`test/inspector/`](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/test/inspector/)),
* V8, Blink, and Chromium unit tests (in [`*_unittest.cc`](https://source.chromium.org/search?q=f:.*_unittest.cc)), and
* Chromium browser tests (in [`*_browsertest.cc`](https://source.chromium.org/search?q=f:.*_browsertest.cc)).

See the [Guide to DevTools Backend Testing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m_RWQ4YrwKqd7wxNqadaLmia1VQIuNKSTzGC3Z9ExUo)
for more details.

## Type checks

The DevTools front-end is written in TypeScript and uses `tsc` (TypeScript Compiler) to check type consistency.
Unless you specify `devtools_skip_typecheck = true` in your `out/Default/args.gn`, running
```
autoninja -C out/Default
```
will automatically check for type consistency.

## Presubmit checks

The [`PRESUBMIT.py`](../PRESUBMIT.py) script includes various checks related to code ownership, localization rules,
license headers, formatting, and the like that are automatically run while uploading a CL (change list), as part of
the CQ (commit queue), and on the [CI (continous integration)](https://ci.chromium.org/p/devtools-frontend/g/main/console).

You can manually trigger the presubmit checks with
```
git cl presubmit
```
on a clean checkout with no uncommitted local changes (you can otherwise pass `--force` to have it execute even
on a dirty tree). This will execute the checks against all the file changed compared to the base branch, because
that's much faster. You can use
```
git cl presubmit --all
```
if you need to run the checks on all files, and not just the modified ones.

Check the section on [Presubmit Scripts](https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/depottools/presubmit-scripts/)
in the main Chromium documentation to learn more about the presubmit API built into `git-cl`.

## Lint checks

We use a set of [ESLint](https://eslint.org) and [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io) rules to perform automated checks,
which are also run as part of the [presubmit checks](#Presubmit-checks).

You can use
```
npm run lint
```
to execute all lint checks, or
```
npm run lint -- '**/*.ts'
npm run lint -- '**/*.css'
```
to execute only the lint checks for TypeScript or CSS files respectively. By default this will fix all issues
that can be automatically corrected; you can pass `--no-fix` to disable this behavior.

The configuration for Stylelint can be found in [`.stylelintrc.json`](../.stylelintrc.json) in the root directory,
whereas ESLint is configured via a toplevel flat config in [`eslint.config.mjs`](../eslint.config.mjs).

The custom ESLint rules live in the [`scripts/eslint_rules` directory](../scripts/eslint_rules/) and are used
to implement checks for DevTools specifics.

## Useful tools

In `.vscode/launch.conf` there are some launch options available for running tests from within VSCode.

The following shell function allows running all tests changed in a given git commit range, in addition to all unit tests
files for all changed code files. Store it in your `.bashrc`.

```
affected() {
  ref="$1"
  if [ -n "$ref" ]; then
    shift 1
  fi
  if [ -z "$ref" -o "$ref" = "--" ]; then
    ref="HEAD"
  fi
  if [ "$1" = "--" ]; then
    shift 1
  fi
  affected=($(ls -d 2>/dev/null $(git diff "$ref" --name-only | sed -e 's,\(\.test\)\?\.ts,.test.ts,' | grep '\.test\.ts') | sort -u | tr '\n' ' '))
  if [ -z "$affected" ]; then
    return
  fi
  npm run test -- "${affected[@]}" $@
}

```
